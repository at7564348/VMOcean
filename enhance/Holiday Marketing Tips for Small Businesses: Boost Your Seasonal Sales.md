## 1. Flash Sales

Flash sales are one of the most effective ways to boost holiday revenue. These short-term promotions create urgency among customers, driven by the "fear of missing out" (FOMO). Announce your flash sale in advance to build anticipation.

For instance, businesses often use Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and New Year sales to generate a significant portion of their annual revenue.
