### Leadpages LeadBoxes

One standout feature is **LeadBoxes**, which are pop-ups that can be strategically placed across your website or blog. These pop-ups can be triggered when visitors click a button, text, or image, or even based on timers. For example:
- **Timed Pop-Ups**: Engage users after they've spent a certain amount of time on your page.
- **Exit Intent Pop-Ups**: Capture leads just as visitors are about to leave your site by offering them valuable content or discounts.

This functionality helps turn more organic and paid traffic into leads effectively.

### Native Ad Creation

Leadpages allows you to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within its platform. This feature automates the ad creation process by pulling content from your landing pages. You can review and tweak these ads before launching them, saving time and ensuring alignment between your ad copy and landing page. Leadpages even adds a Facebook pixel to your pages automatically, enabling you to track performance and retarget leads with precision.

### Split Testing

Split testing, also known as A/B testing, is essential for improving marketing performance. Leadpages simplifies this process by allowing you to test different versions of your landing pages side by side. By comparing conversion rates, you can determine which elementsâ€”such as headlines, images, or CTAsâ€”are driving the best results.
