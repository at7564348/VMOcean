# How to Start an Online Business as a Mum: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

The pandemic has been particularly challenging for mothers, with many experiencing burnout and feeling the strain of juggling work and family life. This has led many mums to consider leaving traditional jobs in favor of starting their own businesses online. If you're one of those mums, this guide is here to help you take the first steps toward creating a flexible and fulfilling online business.

## Getting Started with Your Online Business

### Evaluate Your Skills and Find Your Niche

To begin, make a list of your skills, qualifications, and any services or products you could offer. It's important to determine if there's a demand for your idea. Research your industry to see if others are succeeding with a similar conceptâ€”itâ€™s a great sign that your idea could work too.

When I started my health coaching business, I had limited funds. To generate fast cash flow and gain confidence, I joined a network marketing company. This initial step allowed me to learn essential business skills while earning income to invest in tools and resources for my online business.

### Do You Need Additional Skills or Certifications?

Consider whether you need further qualifications or skills to run your business. For example, I became a certified health coach by studying at the [Institute for Integrative Nutrition](https://bit.ly/LEadPages). Itâ€™s an online program that allows busy mums to learn at their own pace. Gaining additional knowledge can boost your confidence and credibility in your chosen field.

## Choosing a Business Model

There are many business models to choose from. Here are some popular options:

- **Freelancer, Mentor, or Coach**: Offer consulting or mentoring services.
- **Dropshipping**: Sell products without managing inventory.
- **Network Marketing**: Partner with established companies to sell products.
- **Digital Product Creation**: Sell eBooks, courses, or templates.
- **Affiliate Marketing**: Earn commissions by promoting other companiesâ€™ products.

## Setting Up Your Online Business

### Register Your Business

Once youâ€™ve chosen your business model, youâ€™ll need to handle the legal aspects. For example, in Australia, youâ€™ll need to register for an ABN and your business name. You can use your own name or choose a name that resonates with your target audience.

### Building Your Website

Your website is the foundation of your online business. I recommend starting with **Leadpages** for creating high-converting landing pages and opt-in forms. Leadpages' drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to build professional sales pages without technical knowledge.

Once your landing pages are set up, youâ€™ll need cart software to handle payments. My favorite is **ThriveCart**, which offers lifetime access with no monthly fees. It allows you to design user-friendly checkout pages and provides helpful analytics. This is a cost-effective solution, especially for new business owners.

Here are some must-have tools to streamline your workflow:

1. **Canva**: Create stunning digital products, graphics, and social media posts with ease. Canvaâ€™s templates make it beginner-friendly.  
2. **Calendly**: Use this tool to schedule meetings and save time on back-and-forth emails.  
3. **Asana**: Manage your tasks, plan projects, and collaborate with your team.

## Creating Digital Products

Digital products, such as eBooks, online courses, or templates, are a great way to generate passive income. Canva is an excellent platform for designing these products. Its user-friendly interface allows you to create visually appealing workbooks, social media posts, and more.

Balancing work and family life can be challenging, but staying organized is key. Use tools like Asana to track your tasks and projects, and Calendly to simplify scheduling. These tools will help you maximize productivity and reduce stress.
